Place UI sound effect files here. They are loaded from the classpath at /soundeffects/.

Button press (used for dialogs, menus, close, etc.):
  button_press.wav   <- Convert your button_press.m4a to WAV and save it here.
                       Java does not support M4A; use a converter (e.g. Audacity, ffmpeg) to export as WAV.

Other optional files (if missing, those sounds are skipped):
  Equip_fun.wav, Locked.wav, Wrong_sound_effect.wav.ogg, Coins_jingle_(4).wav.ogg, Task_complete.wav
